I'm a grad student in the [Computer Information, Science and Engineering Department](http://cise.ufl.edu) at [University of Florida](http://ufl.edu), working at the [Mobile and Pervasive Computing Laboratory](http://icta.ufl.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. Sumi Helal](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~helal/).

My work focuses on collaborative news creation and circulation using mobile devices, using effects of social networking as the driving agent.

I also enjoy photography, and sometimes publish photos on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/forbiddendreams/).
